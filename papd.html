        <h1>Panic Disorder</h1>
        <ol><h3>
            <li>The individual experiences frequent panic attacks that occur without a clear trigger.</li>
            <li>Ongoing concern about having additional attacks.</li>
            <li>Worry about the implications of an attack (e.g., "I’m having a heart attack" or "I’m losing control").</li>

        </ol></h3>
        <hr>
        <h1>What Cause It</h1>
        <ol><h3>
            <li>A family history of anxiety or panic disorders increases the likelihood of developing the condition. Certain genetic predispositions may make some people more sensitive to stress or fear.
            </li>
            <li>Dysregulation in neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can affect mood and anxiety levels.</li>
            <li>Conditions like hyperthyroidism, low blood sugar, or heart-related issues can mimic or trigger symptoms of panic attacks.
            </li>
            <li>Major life changes or stressors (e.g., moving, starting a new job, divorce, or financial difficulties) can act as triggers.</li>
        </ol></h3>
        <h2>Panic disorder and panic attacks often develop from a combination of these factors, rather than a single cause. The good news is that understanding these underlying mechanisms has helped develop effective treatments, including therapy and medication, to manage and overcome the condition.</h2>

        <br>
        <h1>How To Reduce It</h1>
        <ol><h3>
            <li>Practice Deep Breathing: Slow, deep breaths can help calm the body's stress response</li>
            <li>Remind yourself that a panic attack is not dangerous and will pass</li>
            <li>Practice mindfulness, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to reduce overall stress levels</li>
            <li>Physical activity releases endorphins and can reduce anxiety. Activities like walking, running, yoga, or swimming are effective</li>
            <li>Establish a regular sleep routine, as poor sleep can exacerbate anxiety and panic attacks.</li>
